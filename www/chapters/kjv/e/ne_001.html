<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also [is] broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned [certain] days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, [If] ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But [if] ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, [yet] will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Now these [are] thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</div></div>
