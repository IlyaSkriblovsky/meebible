<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And now [is] not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he said, Who [art] thou? And she answered, I [am] Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou [art] a near kinsman.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, my daughter: [for] thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou [art] a virtuous woman.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And now it is true that I [am thy] near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</div></div>
