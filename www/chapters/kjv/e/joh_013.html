<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], to betray him;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel wherewith he was girded.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>If I then, [your] Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>By this shall all [men] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</div></div>
