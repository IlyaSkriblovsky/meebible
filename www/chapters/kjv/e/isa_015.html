<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beard cut off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.</div></div>
