<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, and approved of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.</div></div>
