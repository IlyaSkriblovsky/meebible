<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>From the sole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Your country [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Thy princes [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them].</div></div>
