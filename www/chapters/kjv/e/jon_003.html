<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered [him] with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And he caused [it] to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that [is] in their hands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Who can tell [if] God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did [it] not.</div></div>
