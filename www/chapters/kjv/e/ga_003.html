<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man's covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>[Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And if ye [be] Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</div></div>
