<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>[Namely], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon [was] a very fat man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of [his] seat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened [them]: and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</div></div>
