<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</div></div>
