<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD [is] upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</div></div>
