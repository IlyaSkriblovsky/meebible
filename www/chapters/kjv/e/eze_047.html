<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters [were] to the ankles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters [were] to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters [were] to the loins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</div></div>
