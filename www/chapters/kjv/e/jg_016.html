<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>[And it was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed [him] in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put [them] upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that [is] before Hebron.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name [was] Delilah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred [pieces] of silver.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength [lieth], and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Now [there were] men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And [there were] liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And she fastened [it] with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, [so] that his soul was vexed unto death;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And she said, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines [were] there; and [there were] upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than [they] which he slew in his life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought [him] up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</div></div>
