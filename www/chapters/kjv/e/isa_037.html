<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, [and] the forest of his Carmel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Hast thou not heard long ago, [how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities [into] ruinous heaps.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Therefore their inhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and [as corn] blasted before it be grown up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat [this] year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were] all dead corpses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</div></div>
