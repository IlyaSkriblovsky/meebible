<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the shapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces [were] as the faces of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And they had a king over them, [which is] the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath [his] name Apollyon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>One woe is past; [and], behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And the number of the army of the horsemen [were] two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails [were] like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</div></div>
