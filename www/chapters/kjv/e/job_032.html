<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they [were] elder than he.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Job, [or] that answered his words:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Now he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>[I said], I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For I know not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away.</div></div>
