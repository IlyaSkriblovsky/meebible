<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For thou hast made of a city an heap; [of] a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; [even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, [and] bring to the ground, [even] to the dust.</div></div>
