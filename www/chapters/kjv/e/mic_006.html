<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, [and] bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn [for] my transgression, the fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure [that is] abominable?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Shall I count [them] pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue [is] deceitful in their mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore also will I make [thee] sick in smiting thee, in making [thee] desolate because of thy sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down [shall be] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and [that] which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</div></div>
