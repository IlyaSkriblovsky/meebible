<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; [so] it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing [of it]; I was dismayed at the seeing [of it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, [and] anoint the shield.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And he saw a chariot [with] a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, [and] a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, [with] a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken [it].</div></div>
