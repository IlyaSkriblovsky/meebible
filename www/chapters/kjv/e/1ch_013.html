<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, [and] with every leader.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If [it seem] good unto you, and [that it be] of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, [that are] left in all the land of Israel, and with them [also] to the priests and Levites [which are] in their cities [and] suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is], to Kirjathjearim, which [belonged] to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth [between] the cherubims, whose name is called [on it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And David and all Israel played before God with all [their] might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God [home] to me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>So David brought not the ark [home] to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</div></div>
