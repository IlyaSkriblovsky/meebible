<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And said unto me, Thou [art] my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: [yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, and my work with my God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb [to be] his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, [and] the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that [are] in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures [shall be] in all high places.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon [their] shoulders.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with [their] face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</div></div>
