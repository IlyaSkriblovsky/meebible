<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>We love him, because he first loved us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</div></div>
