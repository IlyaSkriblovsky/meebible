<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</div></div>
