<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, [so that] he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</div></div>
