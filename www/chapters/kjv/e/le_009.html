<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, [both] of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which [was] for himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt [them] upon the altar.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt [them] upon the burnt offering on the altar.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which [was] the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He slew also the bullock and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings, which [was] for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the caul [above] the liver:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</div></div>
