<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding good land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear [it], (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land: [for] they have heard that thou LORD [art] among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and [that] thy cloud standeth over them, and [that] thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Now [if] thou shalt kill [all] this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>The LORD [is] longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But [as] truly [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Say unto them, [As truly as] I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, [concerning] which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>But [as for] you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of the men that went to search the land, lived [still].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Go not up, for the LORD [is] not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, [even] unto Hormah.</div></div>
