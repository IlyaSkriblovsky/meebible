<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>So he called every one of his lord's debtors [unto him], and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</div></div>
