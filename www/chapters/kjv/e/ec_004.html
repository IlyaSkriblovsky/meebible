<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] not another to help him up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becometh poor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>[There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</div></div>
