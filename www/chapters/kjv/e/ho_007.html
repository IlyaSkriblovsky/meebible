<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, [and] the troop of robbers spoileth without.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And they consider not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They [are] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: [there is] none among them that calleth unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, [and] they rebel against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>They return, [but] not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this [shall be] their derision in the land of Egypt.</div></div>
