<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other five talents.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath ten talents.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked, and clothed [thee]?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</div></div>
