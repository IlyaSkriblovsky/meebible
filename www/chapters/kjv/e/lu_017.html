<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him], through whom they come!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And when he saw [them], he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven, shineth unto the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Remember Lot's wife.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is], thither will the eagles be gathered together.</div></div>
