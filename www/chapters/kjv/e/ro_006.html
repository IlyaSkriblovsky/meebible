<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</div></div>
