<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</div></div>
