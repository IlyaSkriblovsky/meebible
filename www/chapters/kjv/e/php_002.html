<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</div></div>
