<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For this is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And if ye will receive [it], this is Elias, which was for to come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.</div></div>
