<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="55"><div class="verse-label">55</div>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="56"><div class="verse-label">56</div>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="57"><div class="verse-label">57</div>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="58"><div class="verse-label">58</div>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="59"><div class="verse-label">59</div>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</div></div>
