<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For the customs of the people [are] vain: for [one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>They [are] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also [is it] in them to do good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Forasmuch as [there is] none like unto thee, O LORD; thou [art] great, and thy name [is] great in might.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise [men] of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock [is] a doctrine of vanities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple [is] their clothing: they [are] all the work of cunning [men].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But the LORD [is] the true God, he [is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, [even] they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>When he uttereth his voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Every man is brutish in [his] knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>They [are] vanity, [and] the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The portion of Jacob [is] not like them: for he [is] the former of all [things]; and Israel [is] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts [is] his name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find [it so].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this [is] a grief, and I must bear it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, [and] a den of dragons.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</div></div>
