<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it [is] no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither [is] there any water to drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts [also].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>This [is] the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the water of the wells: we will go by the king's [high] way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without [doing] any thing [else], go through on my feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</div></div>
