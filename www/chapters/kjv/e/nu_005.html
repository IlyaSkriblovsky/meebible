<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth [part] thereof, and give [it] unto [him] against whom he hath trespassed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, [even] to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</div></div>
