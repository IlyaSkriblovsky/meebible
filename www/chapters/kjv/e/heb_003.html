<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</div></div>
