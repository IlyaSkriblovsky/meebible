<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>[But] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And at this house, [which] is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>([Now] Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he said, What cities [are] these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And this [is] the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>[For] Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it [for] a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they [were] men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>These [were] the chief of the officers that [were] over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then did he build Millo.</div></div>
