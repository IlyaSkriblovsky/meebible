<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This [man] blasphemeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For whether is easier, to say, [Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And when the Pharisees saw [it], they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But when Jesus heard [that], he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But go ye and learn what [that] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind [him], and touched the hem of his garment:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See [that] no man know [it].</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</div></div>
