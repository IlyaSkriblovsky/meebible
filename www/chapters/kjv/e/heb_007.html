<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</div></div>
