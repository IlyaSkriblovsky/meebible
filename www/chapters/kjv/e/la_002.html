<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, [and] cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought [them] down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>He hath cut off in [his] fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, [which] devoureth round about.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all [that were] pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as [if it were of] a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes [are] among the Gentiles: the law [is] no [more]; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, [and] keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>They say to their mothers, Where [is] corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach [is] great like the sea: who can heal thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying, Is] this the city that [men] call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up: certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>The LORD hath done [that] which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused [thine] enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, [and] children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, [and] not pitied.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</div></div>
