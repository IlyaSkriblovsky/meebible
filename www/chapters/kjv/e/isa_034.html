<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling [fig] from the fig tree.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, [and] with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</div></div>
