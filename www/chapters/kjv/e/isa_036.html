<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, [that] Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence [is] this wherein thou trustest?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I say, [sayest thou], (but [they are but] vain words) [I have] counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is it] not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand [it]: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make [an agreement] with me [by] a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>[Beware] lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Where [are] the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Who [are they] among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with [their] clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</div></div>
