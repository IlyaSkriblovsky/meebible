<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counsellor; [and he was] a good man, and a just:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="55"><div class="verse-label">55</div>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="56"><div class="verse-label">56</div>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</div></div>
