<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make [them] afraid.</div></div>
