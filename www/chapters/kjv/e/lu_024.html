<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And they remembered his words,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And he took [it], and did eat before them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>And ye are witnesses of these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</div></div>
