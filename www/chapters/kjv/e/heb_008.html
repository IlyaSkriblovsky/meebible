<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.</div></div>
