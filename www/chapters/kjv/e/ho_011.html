<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>When Israel [was] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>[As] they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt [him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I [am] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</div></div>
