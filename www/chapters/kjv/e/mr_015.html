<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.</div></div>
