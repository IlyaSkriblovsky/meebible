<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; [Is it] not for you to know judgment?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Therefore night [shall be] unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for [there is] no answer of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, [Is] not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</div></div>
