<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>[There is] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed [be] the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me] my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty [pieces] of silver.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</div></div>
