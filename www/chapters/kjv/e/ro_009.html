<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they [are] not all Israel, which are of Israel:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>(For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>[What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</div></div>
