<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And Elijah the Tishbite, [who was] of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, [As] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which [belongeth] to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And as she was going to fetch [it], he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go [and] do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring [it] unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day [that] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat [many] days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>[And] the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And it came to pass after these things, [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou [art] a man of God, [and] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth [is] truth.</div></div>
