<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? [Was] not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I [be] a father, where [is] mine honour? and if I [be] a master, where [is] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] contemptible.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Who [is there] even among you that would shut the doors [for nought]? neither do ye kindle [fire] on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] polluted; and the fruit thereof, [even] his meat, [is] contemptible.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness [is it]! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But cursed [be] the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I [am] a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name [is] dreadful among the heathen.</div></div>
