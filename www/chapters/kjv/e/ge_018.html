<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it], and make cakes upon the hearth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And he said [unto him], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</div></div>
