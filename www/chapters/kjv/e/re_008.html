<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;</div></div>
