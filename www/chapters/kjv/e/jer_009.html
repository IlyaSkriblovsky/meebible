<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they [be] all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they bend their tongues [like] their bow [for] lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, [and] weary themselves to commit iniquity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Thine habitation [is] in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Their tongue [is as] an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: [one] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Shall I not visit them for these [things]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through [them]; neither can [men] hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, [and] a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Who [is] the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is he] to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth [and] is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, [even] this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning [women], that they may come:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast [us] out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For death is come up into our windows, [and] is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, [and] the young men from the streets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise [man] glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty [man] glory in his might, let not the rich [man] glory in his riches:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these [things] I delight, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all [them which are] circumcised with the uncircumcised;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all [that are] in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all [these] nations [are] uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel [are] uncircumcised in the heart.</div></div>
