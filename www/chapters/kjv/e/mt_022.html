<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But they made light of [it], and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the remnant took his servants, and entreated [them] spitefully, and slew [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But when the king heard [thereof], he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For many are called, but few [are] chosen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] talk.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any [man]: for thou regardest not the person of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>When they had heard [these words], they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And last of all the woman died also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Then one of them, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>This is the first and great commandment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, [The Son] of David.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any [man] from that day forth ask him any more [questions].</div></div>
