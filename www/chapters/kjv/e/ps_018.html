<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>(To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,) I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness [was] under his feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>[As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>For who [is] God save the LORD? or who [is] a rock save our God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>[It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>They cried, but [there was] none to save [them: even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people [whom] I have not known shall serve me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>[It is] God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</div></div>
