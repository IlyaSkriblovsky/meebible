<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen. ([To [the] Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.])</div></div>
