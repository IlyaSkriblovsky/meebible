<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen.</div></div>
