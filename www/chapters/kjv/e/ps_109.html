<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>(To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.) Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For my love they are my adversaries: but I [give myself unto] prayer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Let his days be few; [and] let another take his office.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek [their bread] also out of their desolate places.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Let his posterity be cut off; [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Let it be unto him as the garment [which] covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>[Let] this [be] the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy [is] good, deliver thou me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>I became also a reproach unto them: [when] they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>That they may know that this [is] thy hand; [that] thou, LORD, hast done it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save [him] from those that condemn his soul.</div></div>
