<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Neither as being lords over [God's] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</div></div>
