<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And this [shall be] a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>I said, I shall not see the LORD, [even] the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>I reckoned till morning, [that], as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Like a crane [or] a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail [with looking] upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done [it]: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>O Lord, by these [things men] live, and in all these [things is] the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul [delivered it] from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>The LORD [was ready] to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</div></div>
