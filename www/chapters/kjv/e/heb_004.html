<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</div></div>
