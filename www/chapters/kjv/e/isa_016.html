<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For it shall be, [that], as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, [so] the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>We have heard of the pride of Moab; [he is] very proud: [even] of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: [but] his lies [shall] not [be] so.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely [they are] stricken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come [even] unto Jazer, they wandered [through] the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in [their] presses; I have made [their vintage] shouting to cease.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>This [is] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant [shall be] very small [and] feeble.</div></div>
