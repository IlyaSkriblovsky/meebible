<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, [even] the son of Tabeal:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For the head of Syria [is] Damascus, and the head of Damascus [is] Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, and the head of Samaria [is] Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; [Is it] a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; [even] the king of Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shall hiss for the fly that [is] in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that [is] in the land of Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, [namely], by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk [that] they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall [even] be for briers and thorns.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>With arrows and with bows shall [men] come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And [on] all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</div></div>
