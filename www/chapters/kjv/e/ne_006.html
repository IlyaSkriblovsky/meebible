<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and [that] there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [some one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Wherein [was] written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [There is] a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, [O God], strengthen my hands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who [is there], that, [being] as I [am], would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore [was] he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and [that] they might have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard [thereof], and all the heathen that [were] about us saw [these things], they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For [there were] many in Judah sworn unto him, because he [was] the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</div></div>
