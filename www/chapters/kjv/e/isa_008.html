<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach [even] to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God [is] with us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all [them to] whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, [it is] because [there is] no light in them.</div></div>
