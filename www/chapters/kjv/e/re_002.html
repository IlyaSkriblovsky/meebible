<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But that which ye have [already] hold fast till I come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And I will give him the morning star.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</div></div>
