<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For John was not yet cast into prison.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then there arose a question between [some] of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>He must increase, but I [must] decrease.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</div></div>
