<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate [woman].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch [their] tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this [is] the city to be visited; she [is] wholly oppression in the midst of her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually [is] grief and wounds.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear [is] uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And their houses shall be turned unto others, [with their] fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one [is] given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>They have healed also the hurt [of the daughter] of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time [that] I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where [is] the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk [therein].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Also I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what [is] among them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, [even] the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings [are] not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they [are] cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy [and] fear [is] on every side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>O daughter of my people, gird [thee] with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, [as for] an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>I have set thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>They [are] all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: [they are] brass and iron; they [are] all corrupters.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Reprobate silver shall [men] call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.</div></div>
