<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the [same] maid, to profane my holy name:</div></div>
