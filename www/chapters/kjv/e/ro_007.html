<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</div></div>
