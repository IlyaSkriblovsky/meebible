<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word [was] in my tongue.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And [he shall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun riseth, [even] a morning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Although my house [be] not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all [things], and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he make [it] not to grow.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>These [be] the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same [was] Adino the Eznite: [he lift up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines [that] were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And after him [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</div></div>
