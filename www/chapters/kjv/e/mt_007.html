<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as the scribes.</div></div>
