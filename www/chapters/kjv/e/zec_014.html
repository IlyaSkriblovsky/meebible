<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And [men] shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And it shall be, [that] whoso will not come up of [all] the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that [have] no [rain]; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</div></div>
