<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and should understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see [those things] which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear [those things] which ye hear, and have not heard [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="55"><div class="verse-label">55</div>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="56"><div class="verse-label">56</div>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this [man] all these things?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="57"><div class="verse-label">57</div>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="58"><div class="verse-label">58</div>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</div></div>
