<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth [unto him] whom he would: and they came unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And Simon he surnamed Peter;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he called them [unto him], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</div></div>
