<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Give us this day our daily bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.</div></div>
