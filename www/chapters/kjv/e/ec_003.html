<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.</div></div>
