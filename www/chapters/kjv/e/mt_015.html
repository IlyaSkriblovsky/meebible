<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And honour not his father or his mother, [he shall be free]. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou] Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] to dogs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great [is] thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Then Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake [them], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets full.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</div></div>
