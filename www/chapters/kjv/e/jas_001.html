<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.</div></div>
