<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign [will there be] when these things shall come to pass?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end [is] not by and by.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute [you], delivering [you] up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Settle [it] therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>In your patience possess ye your souls.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called [the mount] of Olives.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.</div></div>
