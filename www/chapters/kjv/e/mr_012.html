<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they caught [him], and beat him, and sent [him] away empty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And they took him, and killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.</div></div>
