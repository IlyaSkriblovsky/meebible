<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned forty years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same [is] the city of David.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David's soul, [he shall be chief and captain]. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts [was] with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And David took [him] more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And these [be] the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went down to the hold.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; [but] fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</div></div>
