<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</div></div>
