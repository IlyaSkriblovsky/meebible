<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.</div></div>
