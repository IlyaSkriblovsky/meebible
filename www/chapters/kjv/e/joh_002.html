<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But he spake of the temple of his body.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</div></div>
