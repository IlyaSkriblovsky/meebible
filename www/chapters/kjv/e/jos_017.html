<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he [was] the firstborn of Joseph; [to wit], for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>There was also [a lot] for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these [were] the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these [are] the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which [were] on the other side Jordan;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that [lieth] before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Southward [it was] Ephraim's, and northward [it was] Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out [the inhabitants of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</div></div>
