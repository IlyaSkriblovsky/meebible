<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>[There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto], more than I?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For [God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</div></div>
