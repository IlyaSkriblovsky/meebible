<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, [and] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook [it], because there was no grass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because [there was] no grass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou [it] for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man [that] turneth aside to tarry for a night?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man [that] cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for [their] good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Do not abhor [us], for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Are there [any] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these [things].</div></div>
