<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>[And] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth [day] of the month, the city was broken up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, [even] Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it came to pass, [that] when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day before thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou [art] afraid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.</div></div>
