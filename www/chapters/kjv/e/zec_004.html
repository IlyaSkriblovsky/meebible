<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all [of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right [side] of the bowl, and the other upon the left [side] thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [are] these, my lord?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This [is] the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Who [art] thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying], Grace, grace unto it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel [with] those seven; they [are] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then answered I, and said unto him, What [are] these two olive trees upon the right [side] of the candlestick and upon the left [side] thereof?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And I answered again, and said unto him, What [be these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these [be]? And I said, No, my lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then said he, These [are] the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</div></div>
