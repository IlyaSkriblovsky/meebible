<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and [from] your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Your fathers, where [are] they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which [is] the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that [were] in the bottom; and behind him [were there] red horses, speckled, and white.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then said I, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these [be].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These [are they] whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me [with] good words [and] comfortable words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen [that are] at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What [be] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</div></div>
