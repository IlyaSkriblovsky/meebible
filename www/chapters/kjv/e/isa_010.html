<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness [which] they have prescribed;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and [that] they may rob the fatherless!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation [which] shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but [it is] in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For he saith, [Are] not my princes altogether kings?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>[Is] not Calno as Carchemish? [is] not Hamath as Arpad? [is] not Samaria as Damascus?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done [it], and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant [man]:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs [that are] left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? [or] shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake [itself] against them that lift it up, [or] as if the staff should lift up [itself, as if it were] no wood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>The remnant shall return, [even] the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and [as] his rod [was] upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand [against] the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature [shall be] hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</div></div>
