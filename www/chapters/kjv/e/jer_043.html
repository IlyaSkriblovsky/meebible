<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>[Even] men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they [even] to Tahpanhes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</div></div>
