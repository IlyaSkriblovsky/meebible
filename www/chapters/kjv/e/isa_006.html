<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth [is] full of his glory.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then said I, Woe [is] me! for I am undone; because I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, [which] he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And he laid [it] upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here [am] I; send me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the LORD have removed men far away, and [there be] a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance [is] in them, when they cast [their leaves: so] the holy seed [shall be] the substance thereof.</div></div>
