<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>[There shall be] no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>A voice of crying [shall be] from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Cursed [be] he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The calamity of Moab [is] near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, [and] the beautiful rod!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, [and] he shall destroy thy strong holds.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, [and] say, What is done?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Make ye him drunken: for he magnified [himself] against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove [that] maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [mine heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; [their] shouting [shall be] no shouting.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>From the cry of Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches [that] he hath gotten are perished.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>[There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>They shall howl, [saying], How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people, because he hath magnified [himself] against the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far [is] the judgment of Moab.</div></div>
