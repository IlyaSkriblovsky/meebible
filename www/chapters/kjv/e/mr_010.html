<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But when Jesus saw [it], he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And he took them up in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and blessed them.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last first.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And when the ten heard [it], they began to be much displeased with James and John.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>But Jesus called them [to him], and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</div></div>
