<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</div></div>
