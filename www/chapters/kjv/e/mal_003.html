<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he [is] like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in [his] wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept [them]. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Ye [are] cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, [even] this whole nation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken [so much] against thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Ye have said, It [is] vain to serve God: and what profit [is it] that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, [they that] tempt God are even delivered.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</div></div>
