<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Not of works, lest any man should boast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</div></div>
