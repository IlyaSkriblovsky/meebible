<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while [it was] yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!
