<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for [this] I make haste.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Knowest thou [not] this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>That the triumphing of the wicked [is] short, and the joy of the hypocrite [but] for a moment?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[Yet] he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where [is] he?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The eye also [which] saw him shall [see him] no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>His bones are full [of the sin] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>[Though] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>[Yet] his meat in his bowels is turned, [it is] the gall of asps within him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall] the restitution [be], and he shall not rejoice [therein].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Because he hath oppressed [and] hath forsaken the poor; [because] he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>[When] he is about to fill his belly, [God] shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain [it] upon him while he is eating.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>He shall flee from the iron weapon, [and] the bow of steel shall strike him through.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>All darkness [shall be] hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>The increase of his house shall depart, [and his goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</div></div>
