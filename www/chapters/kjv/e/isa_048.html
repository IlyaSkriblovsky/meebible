<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, [but] not in truth, nor in righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts [is] his name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did [them] suddenly, and they came to pass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Because I knew that thou [art] obstinate, and thy neck [is] an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I have even from the beginning declared [it] to thee; before it came to pass I shewed [it] thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare [it]? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time [that] thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For mine own sake, [even] for mine own sake, will I do [it]: for how should [my name] be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I [am] he; I [am] the first, I also [am] the last.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: [when] I call unto them, they stand up together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these [things]? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>I, [even] I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there [am] I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I [am] the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way [that] thou shouldest go.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And they thirsted not [when] he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>[There is] no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.</div></div>
