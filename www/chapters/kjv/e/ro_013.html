<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.</div></div>
