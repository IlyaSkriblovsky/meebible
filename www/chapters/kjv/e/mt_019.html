<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made [them] at the beginning made them male and female,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But he said unto them, All [men] cannot receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from [their] mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he laid [his] hands on them, and departed thence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is], God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Honour thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.</div></div>
