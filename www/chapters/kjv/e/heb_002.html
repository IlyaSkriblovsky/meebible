<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</div></div>
