<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [who] can shew forth all his praise?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Blessed [are] they that keep judgment, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour [that thou bearest unto] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked [him] at the sea, [even] at the Red sea.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>They envied Moses also in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] terrible things by the Red sea.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But murmured in their tents, [and] hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Thus they provoked [him] to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and [so] the plague was stayed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And shed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked [him] with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</div></div>
