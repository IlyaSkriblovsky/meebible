<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>This is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</div></div>
