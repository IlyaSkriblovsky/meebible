<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, [there is] no beauty that we should desire him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But he [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore will I divide him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</div></div>
