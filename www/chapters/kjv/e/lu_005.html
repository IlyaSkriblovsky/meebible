<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And so [was] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agreeth not with the old.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>No man also having drunk old [wine] straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</div></div>
