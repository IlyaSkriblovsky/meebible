<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>[Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Israel hath cast off [the thing that is] good: the enemy shall pursue him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain to innocency?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For from Israel [was] it also: the workman made it; therefore it [is] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a strange thing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat [it; but] the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</div></div>
