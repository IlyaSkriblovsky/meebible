<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done [it] of a long [time in such sort] as it was written.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, [who] therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers [were, but] yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children [shall find] compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] face from you, if ye return unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And they arose and took away the altars that [were] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast [them] into the brook Kidron.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For [there were] many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one [that was] not clean, to sanctify [them] unto the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>[That] prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel [there was] not the like in Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to his holy dwelling place, [even] unto heaven.</div></div>
