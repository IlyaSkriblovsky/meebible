<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</div></div>
