<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed [be] the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Which I commanded your fathers in the day [that] I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is] this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day [that] I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, [even] unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do; but they did [them] not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing, [even] altars to burn incense unto Baal.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear [them] in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>What hath my beloved to do in mine house, [seeing] she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, [and] of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And the LORD hath given me knowledge [of it], and I know [it]: then thou shewedst me their doings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But I [was] like a lamb [or] an ox [that] is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, [even] the year of their visitation.</div></div>
