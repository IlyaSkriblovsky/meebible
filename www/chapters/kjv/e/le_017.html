<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>What man soever [there be] of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth [it] out of the camp,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them [for] peace offerings unto the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man [there be] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For [it is] the life of all flesh; the blood of it [is] for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh [is] the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And every soul that eateth that which died [of itself], or that which was torn [with beasts, whether it be] one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.</div></div>
