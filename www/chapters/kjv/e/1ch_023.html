<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Of which, twenty and four thousand [were] to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand [were] officers and judges:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Moreover four thousand [were] porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, [said David], to praise [therewith].</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to [their] father's house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Now [concerning] Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</div></div>
