<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Of sin, because they believe not on me;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</div></div>
