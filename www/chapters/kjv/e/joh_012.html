<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], which should betray him,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</div></div>
