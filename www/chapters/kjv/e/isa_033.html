<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The earth mourneth [and] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed [and] hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their fruits].</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence [shall be] the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure.</div></div>
