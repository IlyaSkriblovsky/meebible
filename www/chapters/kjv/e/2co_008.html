<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But thanks [be] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Whether [any do enquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be enquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</div></div>
