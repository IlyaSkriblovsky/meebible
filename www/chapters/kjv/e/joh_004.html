<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And he must needs go through Samaria.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And many more believed because of his own word;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</div></div>
