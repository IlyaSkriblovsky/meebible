<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</div></div>
