<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Ye know that after two days is [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill [him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar among the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it], and brake [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="55"><div class="verse-label">55</div>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="56"><div class="verse-label">56</div>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="57"><div class="verse-label">57</div>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="58"><div class="verse-label">58</div>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="59"><div class="verse-label">59</div>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="60"><div class="verse-label">60</div>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="61"><div class="verse-label">61</div>And said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="62"><div class="verse-label">62</div>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] these witness against thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="63"><div class="verse-label">63</div>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="64"><div class="verse-label">64</div>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="65"><div class="verse-label">65</div>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="66"><div class="verse-label">66</div>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="67"><div class="verse-label">67</div>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="68"><div class="verse-label">68</div>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="69"><div class="verse-label">69</div>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="70"><div class="verse-label">70</div>But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="71"><div class="verse-label">71</div>And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="72"><div class="verse-label">72</div>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="73"><div class="verse-label">73</div>And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="74"><div class="verse-label">74</div>Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="75"><div class="verse-label">75</div>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</div></div>
