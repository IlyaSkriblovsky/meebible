<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</div></div>
