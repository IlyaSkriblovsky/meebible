<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For there is no respect of persons with God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>(For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.</div></div>
