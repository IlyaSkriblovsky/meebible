<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock [whence] ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit [whence] ye are digged.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah [that] bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>My righteousness [is] near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart [is] my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. [Art] thou not it that hath cut Rahab, [and] wounded the dragon?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>[Art] thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy [shall be] upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I, [even] I, [am] he that comforteth you: who [art] thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man [that] shall die, and of the son of man [which] shall be made [as] grass;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where [is] the fury of the oppressor?</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou [art] my people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, [and] wrung [them] out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>[There is] none to guide her among all the sons [whom] she hath brought forth; neither [is there any] that taketh her by the hand of all the sons [that] she hath brought up.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God [that] pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, [even] the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</div></div>
