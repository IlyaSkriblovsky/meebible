<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And these [are] the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Alas! for that day [is] great, so that none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make [him] afraid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise [is] incurable, [and] thy wound [is] grievous.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>[There is] none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; [because] thy sins were increased.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow [is] incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: [because] thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, [saying], This [is] Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who [is] this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done [it], and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</div></div>
