<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Thus saith the LORD, Where [is] the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors [is it] to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Wherefore, when I came, [was there] no man? when I called, [was there] none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because [there is] no water, and dieth for thirst.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to [him that is] weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>[He is] near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who [is] mine adversary? let him come near to me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who [is] he [that] shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Who [is] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh [in] darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass [yourselves] about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks [that] ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.</div></div>
