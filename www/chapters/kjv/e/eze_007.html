<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</div></div>
