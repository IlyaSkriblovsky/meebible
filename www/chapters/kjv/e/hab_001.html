<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out unto thee [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence [are] before me: and there are [that] raise up strife and contention.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye will not believe, though it be told [you].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] not theirs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle [that] hasteth to eat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, [imputing] this his power unto his god.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>[Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is] more righteous than he?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, [that have] no ruler over them?</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat plenteous.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</div></div>
