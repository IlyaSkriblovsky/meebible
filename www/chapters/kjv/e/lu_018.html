<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And they shall scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.</div></div>
