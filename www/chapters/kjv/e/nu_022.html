<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan [by] Jericho.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they [were] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they [are] too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, [that] we may smite them, and [that] I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest [is] blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men [are] these with thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying],</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Behold, [there is] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that [were] with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people.</div></div>
