<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</div></div>
