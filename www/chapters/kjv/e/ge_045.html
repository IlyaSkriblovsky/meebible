<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I [am] Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I [am] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>So now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And there will I nourish thee; for yet [there are] five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth that speaketh unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And told him, saying, Joseph [is] yet alive, and he [is] governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And Israel said, [It is] enough; Joseph my son [is] yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</div></div>
