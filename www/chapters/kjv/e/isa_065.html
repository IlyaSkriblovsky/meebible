<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>I am sought of [them that] asked not [for me]; I am found of [them that] sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation [that] was not called by my name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way [that was] not good, after their own thoughts;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable [things is in] their vessels;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These [are] a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Behold, [it is] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [one] saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing [is] in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But ye [are] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose [that] wherein I delighted not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever [in that] which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner [being] an hundred years old shall be accursed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And they shall build houses, and inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree [are] the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they [are] the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust [shall be] the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</div></div>
