<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every [word] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</div></div>
