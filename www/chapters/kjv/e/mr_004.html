<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>The sower soweth the word.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it], and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</div></div>
