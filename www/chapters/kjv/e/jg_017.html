<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name [was] Micah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [shekels] of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver [is] with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed [be thou] of the LORD, my son.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>In those days [there was] no king in Israel, [but] every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who [was] a Levite, and he sojourned there.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find [a place]: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I [am] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to [my] priest.</div></div>
