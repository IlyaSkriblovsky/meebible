<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>[There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But ye have not so learned Christ;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Neither give place to the devil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</div></div>
