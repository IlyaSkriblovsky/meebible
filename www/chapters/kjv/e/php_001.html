<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.</div></div>
