<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim [is] my firstborn.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare [it] in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd [doth] his flock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of [him that was] stronger than he.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, [and] the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts [is] his name:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, [then] the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.</div></div>
