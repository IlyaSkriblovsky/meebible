<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>(To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David.) Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! [for then] would I fly away, and be at rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Lo, [then] would I wander far off, [and] remain in the wilderness. Selah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I would hasten my escape from the windy storm [and] tempest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow [are] in the midst of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Wickedness [is] in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For [it was] not an enemy [that] reproached me; then I could have borne [it]: neither [was it] he that hated me [that] did magnify [himself] against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But [it was] thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>We took sweet counsel together, [and] walked unto the house of God in company.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Let death seize upon them, [and] let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness [is] in their dwellings, [and] among them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me: for there were many with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>[The words] of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war [was] in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet [were] they drawn swords.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</div></div>
