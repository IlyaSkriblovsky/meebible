<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shame do love, Give ye.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</div></div>
