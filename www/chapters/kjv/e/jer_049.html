<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he [is] not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve [them] alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</div></div>
