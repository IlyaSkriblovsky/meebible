<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, [and] as the waters [that are] poured down a steep place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, [and] as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For her wound [is] incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, [even] to Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Declare ye [it] not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she [is] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib [shall be] a lie to the kings of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</div></div>
