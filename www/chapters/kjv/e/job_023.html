<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then Job answered and said,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Even to day [is] my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Oh that I knew where I might find him! [that] I might come [even] to his seat!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I would know the words [which] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Will he plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But he knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But he [is] in one [mind], and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Because I was not cut off before the darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darkness from my face.</div></div>
