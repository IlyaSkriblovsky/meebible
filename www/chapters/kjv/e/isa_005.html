<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts [is] the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Woe unto them that join house to house, [that] lay field to field, till [there be] no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>In mine ears [said] the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, without inhabitant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, [that] they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, [till] wine inflame them!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because [they have] no knowledge: and their honourable men [are] famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>That say, Let him make speed, [and] hasten his work, that we may see [it]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know [it]!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Woe unto [them that are] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Woe unto [them that are] mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, [so] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases [were] torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Whose arrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Their roaring [shall be] like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry [it] away safe, and none shall deliver [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if [one] look unto the land, behold darkness [and] sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.</div></div>
