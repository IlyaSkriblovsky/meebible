<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>(Maschil of Asaph.) Give ear, O my people, [to] my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>We will not hide [them] from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>That the generation to come might know [them, even] the children [which] should be born; [who] should arise and declare [them] to their children:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation [that] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The children of Ephraim, [being] armed, [and] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as [out of] the great depths.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Therefore the LORD heard [this], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And he let [it] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat [was] yet in their mouths,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen [men] of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>For he remembered that they [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] grieve him in the desert!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>They remembered not his hand, [nor] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels [among them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of [their] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="54"><div class="verse-label">54</div>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [even to] this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="55"><div class="verse-label">55</div>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="56"><div class="verse-label">56</div>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="57"><div class="verse-label">57</div>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="58"><div class="verse-label">58</div>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="59"><div class="verse-label">59</div>When God heard [this], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="60"><div class="verse-label">60</div>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] he placed among men;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="61"><div class="verse-label">61</div>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="62"><div class="verse-label">62</div>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="63"><div class="verse-label">63</div>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="64"><div class="verse-label">64</div>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="65"><div class="verse-label">65</div>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="66"><div class="verse-label">66</div>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="67"><div class="verse-label">67</div>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="68"><div class="verse-label">68</div>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="69"><div class="verse-label">69</div>And he built his sanctuary like high [palaces], like the earth which he hath established for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="70"><div class="verse-label">70</div>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="71"><div class="verse-label">71</div>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="72"><div class="verse-label">72</div>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</div></div>
