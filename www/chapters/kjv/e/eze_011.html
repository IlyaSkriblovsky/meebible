<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Then said he unto me, Son of man, these [are] the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, [every one of] them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But [as for them] whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</div></div>
