<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings [are here]!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shall be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any [man] deceive you:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and shall deceive many.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end [shall] not [be] yet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [are] the beginnings of sorrows.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against [their] parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter [therein], to take any thing out of his house:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ; or, lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, [even] at the doors.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>But of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>[For the Son of man is] as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</div></div>
