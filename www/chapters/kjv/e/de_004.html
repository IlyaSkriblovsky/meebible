<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Know therefore this day, and consider [it] in thine heart, that the LORD he [is] God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: [there is] none else.</div></div>
