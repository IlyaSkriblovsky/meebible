<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou [wast] he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which [is] Jebus; where the Jebusites [were], the inhabitants of the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which [is] the city of David.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>These also [are] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, [and] with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain [by him] at one time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was one] of the three mighties.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And they set themselves in the midst of [that] parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved [them] by a great deliverance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And David [was] then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison [was] then at Bethlehem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that [is] at the gate!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: but David would not drink [of] it, but poured it out to the LORD,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew [them], and had a name among the three.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the [first] three.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</div></div>
