<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And the breadth of the door [was] ten cubits; and the sides of the door [were] five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This [is] the most holy [place].</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the side chambers [were] three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which [was] of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And [there was] an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house [was still] upward, and so increased [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the midst.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers [were] a full reed of six great cubits.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And [it was] made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree [was] between a cherub and a cherub; and [every] cherub had two faces;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>So that the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: [it was] made through all the house round about.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>From the ground unto above the door [were] cherubims and palm trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>The posts of the temple [were] squared, [and] the face of the sanctuary; the appearance [of the one] as the appearance [of the other].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>The altar of wood [was] three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, [were] of wood: and he said unto me, This [is] the table that [is] before the LORD.</div></div>
