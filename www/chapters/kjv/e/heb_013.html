<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Let brotherly love continue.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>[Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</div></div>
