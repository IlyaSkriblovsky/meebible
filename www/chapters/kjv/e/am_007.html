<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, [it was] the latter growth after the king's mowings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And it came to pass, [that] when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it [is] the king's chapel, and it [is] the king's court.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no prophet, neither [was] I a prophet's son; but I [was] an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</div></div>
