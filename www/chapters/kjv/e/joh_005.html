<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>But I have greater witness than [that] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>I receive not honour from men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that [cometh] from God only?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</div></div>
