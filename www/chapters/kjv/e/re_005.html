<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four [and] twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</div></div>
