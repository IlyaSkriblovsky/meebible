<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And a man's foes [shall be] they of his own household.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</div></div>
