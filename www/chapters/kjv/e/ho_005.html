<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I [have been] a rebuker of them all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, [and] Israel is defiled.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms [is] in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find [him]; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, [and] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud [at] Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore [will] I [be] unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For I [will be] unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, [even] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue [him].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>I will go [and] return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</div></div>
