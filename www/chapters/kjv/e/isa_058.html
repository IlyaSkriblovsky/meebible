<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Wherefore have we fasted, [say they], and thou seest not? [wherefore] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as [ye do this] day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? [is it] to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes [under him]? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>[Is] not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[Is it] not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I [am]. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And [if] thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness [be] as the noonday:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And [they that shall be] of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, [from] doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking [thine own] words:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].</div></div>
