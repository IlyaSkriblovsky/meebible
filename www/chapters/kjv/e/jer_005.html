<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be [any] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>O LORD, [are] not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, [but] they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Therefore I said, Surely these [are] poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, [nor] the judgment of their God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, [and] the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, [and] burst the bonds.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, [and] a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, [and] their backslidings are increased.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by [them that are] no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>They were [as] fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Shall I not visit for these [things]? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they [are] not the LORD'S.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>They have belied the LORD, and said, [It is] not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word [is] not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it [is] a mighty nation, it [is] an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Their quiver [is] as an open sepulchre, they [are] all mighty men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, [which] thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these [things] unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land [that is] not yours.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Your iniquities have turned away these [things], and your sins have withholden good [things] from you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For among my people are found wicked [men]: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>As a cage is full of birds, so [are] their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Shall I not visit for these [things]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love [to have it] so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?</div></div>
