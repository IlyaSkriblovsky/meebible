<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay [is] in the potter's hand, so [are] ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[At what] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy [it];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And [at what] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant [it];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Will [a man] leave the snow of Lebanon [which cometh] from the rock of the field? [or] shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways [from] the ancient paths, to walk in paths, [in] a way not cast up;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>To make their land desolate, [and] a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, [and] to turn away thy wrath from them.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay [me]: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal [thus] with them in the time of thine anger.</div></div>
