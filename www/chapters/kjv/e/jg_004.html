<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host [was] Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, [saying], Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, [then] I will not go.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now Heber the Kenite, [which was] of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which [is] by Kedesh.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, [even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were] with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this [is] the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all [his] chariots, and all [his] host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off [his] chariot, and fled away on his feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; [and] there was not a man left.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</div></div>
