<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and [for] my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I [am] strong.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness [is] great.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD [is] near in the valley of decision.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD [will be] the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>So shall ye know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence [against] the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For I will cleanse their blood [that] I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</div></div>
