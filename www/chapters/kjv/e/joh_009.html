<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>We know that God spake unto Moses: [as for] this [fellow], we know not from whence he is.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</div></div>
