<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>But in the last days it shall come to pass, [that] the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make [them] afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? [is there] no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go [even] to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</div></div>
