<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; [but] they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, [even] lovingkindness and mercies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall [men] lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Neither shall [men] tear [themselves] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall [men] give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what [is] our iniquity? or what [is] our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, [neither] ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>For mine eyes [are] upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and [things] wherein [there is] no profit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they [are] no gods?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name [is] The LORD.</div></div>
