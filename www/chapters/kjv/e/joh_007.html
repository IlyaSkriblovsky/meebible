<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of myself.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="43"><div class="verse-label">43</div>So there was a division among the people because of him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="44"><div class="verse-label">44</div>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="45"><div class="verse-label">45</div>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="46"><div class="verse-label">46</div>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="47"><div class="verse-label">47</div>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="48"><div class="verse-label">48</div>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="49"><div class="verse-label">49</div>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="50"><div class="verse-label">50</div>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="51"><div class="verse-label">51</div>Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="52"><div class="verse-label">52</div>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="53"><div class="verse-label">53</div>And every man went unto his own house.</div></div>
