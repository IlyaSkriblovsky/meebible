<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe of Benjamin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>If by any means I may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever. Amen.</div></div>
