<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</div></div>
