<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</div></div>
