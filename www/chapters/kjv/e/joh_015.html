<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joy might be full.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>These things I command you, that ye love one another.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</div></div>
