<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, [even] for all this remnant; (for we are left [but] a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</div></div>
