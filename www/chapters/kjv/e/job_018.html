<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>How long [will it be ere] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile in your sight?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>The gin shall take [him] by the heel, [and] the robber shall prevail against him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The snare [is] laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready at his side.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>It shall devour the strength of his skin: [even] the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [it is] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>They that come after [him] shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Surely such [are] the dwellings of the wicked, and this [is] the place [of him that] knoweth not God.</div></div>
