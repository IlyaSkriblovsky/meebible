<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Righteous [art] thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of [thy] judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? [wherefore] are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou [art] near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and [if] in the land of peace, [wherein] thou trustedst, [they wearied thee], then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Mine heritage [is] unto me [as] a speckled bird, the birds round about [are] against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>They have made it desolate, [and being] desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth [it] to heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the [one] end of the land even to the [other] end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, [but] shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.</div></div>
