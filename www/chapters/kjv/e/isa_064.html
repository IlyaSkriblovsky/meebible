<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>As [when] the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, [that] the nations may tremble at thy presence!</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>When thou didst terrible things [which] we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For since the beginning of the world [men] have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, [what] he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, [those that] remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But we are all as an unclean [thing], and all our righteousnesses [are] as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And [there is] none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But now, O LORD, thou [art] our father; we [are] the clay, and thou our potter; and we all [are] the work of thy hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Wilt thou refrain thyself for these [things], O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</div></div>
