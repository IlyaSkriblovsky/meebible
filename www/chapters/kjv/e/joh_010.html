<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am known of mine.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>I and [my] Father are one.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="38"><div class="verse-label">38</div>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="39"><div class="verse-label">39</div>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="40"><div class="verse-label">40</div>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="41"><div class="verse-label">41</div>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="42"><div class="verse-label">42</div>And many believed on him there.</div></div>
