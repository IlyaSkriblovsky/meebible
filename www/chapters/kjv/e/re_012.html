<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</div></div>
