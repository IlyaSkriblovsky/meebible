<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, [that] the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, [even] in Chisleu;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>[And] to speak unto the priests which [were] in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh [month], even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, [even] to me?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat [for yourselves], and drink [for yourselves]?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>[Should ye] not [hear] the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when [men] inhabited the south and the plain?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Yea, they made their hearts [as] an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Therefore it is come to pass, [that] as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</div></div>
