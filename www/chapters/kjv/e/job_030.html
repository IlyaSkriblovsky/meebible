<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>[They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</div></div>
