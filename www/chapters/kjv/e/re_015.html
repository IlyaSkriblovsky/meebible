<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy ways, thou King of saints.</div></div>
