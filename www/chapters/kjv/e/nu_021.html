<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for [there is] no bread, neither [is there any] water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which [is] before Moab, toward the sunrising.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which [is] in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon [is] the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of the well: [but] we will go along by the king's [high] way, until we be past thy borders.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was] strong.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, [and] the lords of the high places of Arnon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</div></div>
