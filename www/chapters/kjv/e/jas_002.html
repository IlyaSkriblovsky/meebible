<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</div></div>
