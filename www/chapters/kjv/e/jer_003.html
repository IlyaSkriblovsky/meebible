<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen [that] which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>And I said after she had done all these [things], Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; [and] I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I [am] merciful, saith the LORD, [and] I will not keep [anger] for ever.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit [it]; neither shall [that] be done any more.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping [and] supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, [and] they have forgotten the LORD their God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Return, ye backsliding children, [and] I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou [art] the LORD our God.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Truly in vain [is salvation hoped for] from the hills, [and from] the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</div></div>
