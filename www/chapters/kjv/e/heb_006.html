<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>And this will we do, if God permit.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</div></div>
