<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>([A Psalm] of David.) Plead [my cause], O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>Draw out also the spear, and stop [the way] against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I [am] thy salvation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase [them].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>For without cause have they hid for me their net [in] a pit, [which] without cause they have digged for my soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>All my bones shall say, LORD, who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge [things] that I knew not.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>They rewarded me evil for good [to] the spoiling of my soul.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing [was] sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>I behaved myself as though [he had been] my friend [or] brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth [for his] mother.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: [yea], the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew [it] not; they did tear [me], and ceased not:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: [neither] let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against [them that are] quiet in the land.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, [and] said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen [it].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>[This] thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, [even] unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify [themselves] against me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness [and] of thy praise all the day long.</div></div>
