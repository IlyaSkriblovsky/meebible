<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="1"><div class="verse-label">1</div>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="2"><div class="verse-label">2</div>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="3"><div class="verse-label">3</div>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="4"><div class="verse-label">4</div>And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="5"><div class="verse-label">5</div>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="6"><div class="verse-label">6</div>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="7"><div class="verse-label">7</div>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="8"><div class="verse-label">8</div>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="9"><div class="verse-label">9</div>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="10"><div class="verse-label">10</div>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="11"><div class="verse-label">11</div>But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="12"><div class="verse-label">12</div>And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="13"><div class="verse-label">13</div>Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="14"><div class="verse-label">14</div>And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="15"><div class="verse-label">15</div>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="16"><div class="verse-label">16</div>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="17"><div class="verse-label">17</div>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="18"><div class="verse-label">18</div>And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="19"><div class="verse-label">19</div>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="20"><div class="verse-label">20</div>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="21"><div class="verse-label">21</div>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="22"><div class="verse-label">22</div>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="23"><div class="verse-label">23</div>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="24"><div class="verse-label">24</div>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="25"><div class="verse-label">25</div>For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="26"><div class="verse-label">26</div>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="27"><div class="verse-label">27</div>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="28"><div class="verse-label">28</div>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="29"><div class="verse-label">29</div>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="30"><div class="verse-label">30</div>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="31"><div class="verse-label">31</div>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="32"><div class="verse-label">32</div>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="33"><div class="verse-label">33</div>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="34"><div class="verse-label">34</div>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="35"><div class="verse-label">35</div>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="36"><div class="verse-label">36</div>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];</div></div>
<div class="par"><div class="verse" verse="37"><div class="verse-label">37</div>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</div></div>
