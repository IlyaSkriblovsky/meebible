{1}In the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and proceeded to lay siege to it.
{2}In time Jehovah gave into his hand Jehoiakim the king of Judah and a part of the utensils of the house of the [true] God, so that he brought them to the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and the utensils he brought to the treasure-house of his god.
|
{3}Then the king said to Ashpenaz his chief court official to bring some of the sons of Israel and of the royal offspring and of the nobles,
{4}children in whom there was no defect at all, but good in appearance and having insight into all wisdom and being acquainted with knowledge, and having discernment of what is known, in whom also there was ability to stand in the palace of the king; and to teach them the writing and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
{5}Furthermore, to them the king appointed a daily allowance from the delicacies of the king and from his drinking wine, even to nourish them for three years, that at the end of these they might stand before the king.
|
{6}Now there happened to be among them some of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
{7}And to them the principal court official went assigning names. So he assigned to Daniel [the name of] Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, Shadrach; and to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
|
{8}But Daniel determined in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the delicacies of the king and with his drinking wine. And he kept requesting of the principal court official that he might not pollute himself.
{9}Accordingly the [true] God gave Daniel over to loving-kindness and to mercy before the principal court official.
{10}So the principal court official said to Daniel: “I am in fear of my lord the king, who has appointed YOUR food and YOUR drink. Why, then, should he see YOUR faces dejected-looking in comparison with the children who are of the same age as YOURS, and [why] should YOU have to make my head guilty to the king?”
{11}But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah:
{12}“Please, put your servants to the test for ten days, and let them give us some vegetables that we may eat and water that we may drink;
{13}and let our countenances and the countenance of the children who are eating the delicacies of the king appear before you, and according to what you see do with your servants.”
|
{14}Finally he listened to them as regards this matter and put them to the test for ten days.
{15}And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the children who were eating the delicacies of the king.
{16}So the guardian kept on taking away their delicacies and their drinking wine and giving them vegetables.
{17}And as for these children, the four of them, to them the [true] God gave knowledge and insight in all writing and wisdom; and Daniel himself had understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams.
|
{18}And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in, the principal court official also proceeded to bring them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
{19}And the king began to speak with them, and out of them all no one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; and they continued to stand before the king.
{20}And as regards every matter of wisdom [and] understanding that the king inquired about from them, he even got to find them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests [and] the conjurers that were in all his royal realm.
{21}And Daniel continued on until the first year of Cyrus the king.
|
{1}And in the second year of the kingship of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit began to feel agitated, and his very sleep was made to be something beyond him.
{2}So the king said to call the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. And they proceeded to come in and to stand before the king.
{3}Then the king said to them: “There is a dream that I have dreamed, and my spirit is agitated to know the dream.”
{4}At that the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Aramaic language: “O king, live on even for times indefinite. Say what the dream is to your servants, and we shall show the very interpretation.”
|
{5}The king was answering and saying to the Chaldeans: “The word is being promulgated by me: If YOU men do not make the dream known to me, and its interpretation, dismembered is what YOU will be, and into public privies YOUR own houses will be turned.
{6}But if the dream and its interpretation YOU will show, gifts and a present and much dignity YOU will receive on my part. Therefore show me the very dream and its interpretation.”
|
{7}They answered a second time and were saying: “Let the king say what the dream is to his servants, and we shall show its very interpretation.”
|
{8}The king was answering and saying: “For a fact, I am aware that time is what YOU men are trying to gain, forasmuch as YOU have perceived that the word is being promulgated by me.
{9}For if YOU do not make known to me the very dream, this one and only sentence is upon YOU. But it is a lying and wrong word that YOU have agreed to say before me, until the time itself is changed. Therefore tell me the very dream, and I shall know that YOU can show the very interpretation of it.”
|
{10}The Chaldeans answered before the king, and they were saying: “There does not exist a man on the dry land that is able to show the matter of the king, forasmuch as no grand king or governor has asked such a thing as this of any magic-practicing priest or conjurer or Chaldean.
{11}But the thing that the king himself is asking is difficult, and nobody else exists who can show it before the king except the gods, whose own dwelling does not exist with flesh at all.”
|
{12}Because of this the king himself became angry and got very furious, and he said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
{13}And the order itself went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they looked for Daniel and his companions, for them to be killed.
|
{14}At that time Daniel, for his part, addressed himself with counsel and sensibleness to Arioch the chief of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
{15}He was answering and saying to Arioch the officer of the king: “For what reason is there such a harsh order on the part of the king?” Then it was that Arioch made known the matter itself to Daniel.
{16}So Daniel himself went in and asked from the king that he should give him time expressly to show the very interpretation to the king.
|
{17}After that Daniel went to his own house; and to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah his companions he made known the matter,
{18}even [for them] to ask for mercies on the part of the God of heaven concerning this secret, in order that they might not destroy Daniel and his companions with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon.
|
{19}Then it was that to Daniel in a night vision the secret was revealed. Consequently Daniel himself blessed the God of heaven.
{20}Daniel was answering and saying: “Let the name of God become blessed from time indefinite even to time indefinite, for wisdom and mightiness—for they belong to him.
{21}And he is changing times and seasons, removing kings and setting up kings, giving wisdom to the wise ones and knowledge to those knowing discernment.
{22}He is revealing the deep things and the concealed things, knowing what is in the darkness; and with him the light does dwell.
{23}To you, O God of my forefathers, I am giving praise and commendation, because wisdom and mightiness you have given to me. And now you have made known to me what we requested of you, for you have made known to us the very matter of the king.”
|
{24}Because of this Daniel himself went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went, and this is what he said to him: “Do not destroy any wise men of Babylon. Take me in before the king, that I may show the interpretation itself to the king.”
|
{25}Then it was that Arioch, in a hurry, took Daniel in before the king, and this is what he said to him: “I have found an able-bodied man of the exiles of Judah who can make known the interpretation itself to the king.”
{26}The king was answering and saying to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: “Are you competent enough to make known to me the dream that I beheld, and its interpretation?”
{27}Daniel was answering before the king and saying: “The secret that the king himself is asking, the wise men, the conjurers, the magic-practicing priests [and] the astrologers themselves are unable to show to the king.
{28}However, there exists a God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to occur in the final part of the days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed—this it is:
|
{29}“As for you, O king, on your bed your own thoughts came up as regards what is to occur after this, and the One who is the Revealer of secrets has made known to you what is to occur.
{30}And as for me, it is not through any wisdom that exists in me more than in any others alive that this secret is revealed to me, except to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king himself and that the thoughts of your heart you may know.
|
{31}“You, O king, happened to be beholding, and, look! a certain immense image. That image, which was large and the brightness of which was extraordinary, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was dreadful.
{32}As regards that image, its head was of good gold, its breasts and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs were of copper,
{33}its legs were of iron, its feet were partly of iron and partly of molded clay.
{34}You kept on looking until a stone was cut out not by hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and of molded clay and crushed them.
{35}At that time the iron, the molded clay, the copper, the silver and the gold were, all together, crushed and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away so that no trace at all was found of them. And as for the stone that struck the image, it became a large mountain and filled the whole earth.
|
{36}“This is the dream, and its interpretation we shall say before the king.
{37}You, O king, the king of kings, you to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the might, and the strength and the dignity,
{38}and into whose hand he has given, wherever the sons of mankind are dwelling, the beasts of the field and the winged creatures of the heavens, and whom he has made ruler over all of them, you yourself are the head of gold.
|
{39}“And after you there will rise another kingdom inferior to you; and another kingdom, a third one, of copper, that will rule over the whole earth.
|
{40}“And as for the fourth kingdom, it will prove to be strong like iron. Forasmuch as iron is crushing and grinding everything else, so, like iron that shatters, it will crush and shatter even all these.
|
{41}“And whereas you beheld the feet and the toes to be partly of molded clay of a potter and partly of iron, the kingdom itself will prove to be divided, but somewhat of the hardness of iron will prove to be in it, forasmuch as you beheld the iron mixed with moist clay.
{42}And as for the toes of the feet being partly of iron and partly of molded clay, the kingdom will partly prove to be strong and will partly prove to be fragile.
{43}Whereas you beheld iron mixed with moist clay, they will come to be mixed with the offspring of mankind; but they will not prove to be sticking together, this one to that one, just as iron is not mixing with molded clay.
|
{44}“And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite;
{45}forasmuch as you beheld that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, and [that] it crushed the iron, the copper, the molded clay, the silver and the gold. The grand God himself has made known to the king what is to occur after this. And the dream is reliable, and the interpretation of it is trustworthy.”
|
{46}At that time King Nebuchadnezzar himself fell down upon his face, and to Daniel he paid homage, and he said to offer even a present and incense to him.
{47}The king was answering Daniel and saying: “Truly the God of YOU men is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a Revealer of secrets, because you were able to reveal this secret.”
{48}Consequently the king made Daniel someone great, and many big gifts he gave to him, and he made him the ruler over all the jurisdictional district of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
{49}And Daniel, for his part, made a request of the king, and he appointed over the administration of the jurisdictional district of Babylon Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, but Daniel was in the court of the king.
|
{1}Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits [and] the breadth of which was six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura in the jurisdictional district of Babylon.
{2}And Nebuchadnezzar himself as king sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the police magistrates and all the administrators of the jurisdictional districts to come to the inauguration of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
|
{3}At that time the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the police magistrates and all the administrators of the jurisdictional districts were assembling themselves for the inauguration of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and they were standing in front of the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
{4}And the herald was crying out loudly: “To YOU it is being said, O peoples, national groups and languages,
{5}that at the time that YOU hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, YOU fall down and worship the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
{6}And whoever does not fall down and worship will at the same moment be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.”
{7}Because of this, at the same time as all the peoples were hearing the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument and all sorts of musical instruments, all the peoples, national groups and languages were falling down [and] worshiping the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
|
{8}Because of this, at that same time certain Chaldeans approached and accused the Jews.
{9}They answered, and they were saying to Nebuchadnezzar the king: “O king, live on even for times indefinite.
{10}You yourself, O king, set forth the command that every man that hears the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, and the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, should fall down and worship the image of gold;
{11}and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
{12}There exist certain Jews whom you appointed over the administration of the jurisdictional district of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; these able-bodied men have paid no regard to you, O king, they are not serving your own gods, and the image of gold that you have set up they are not worshiping.”
|
{13}At that time Nebuchadnezzar, in a rage and fury, said to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Consequently these able-bodied men were brought in before the king.
{14}Nebuchadnezzar was answering and saying to them: “Is it really so, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that YOU are not serving my own gods, and the image of gold that I have set up YOU are not worshiping?
{15}Now if YOU are ready so that when YOU hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, and the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, YOU fall down and worship the image that I have made, [all right]. But if YOU do not worship, at that same moment YOU will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is that god that can rescue YOU out of my hands?”
|
{16}Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered, and they were saying to the king: “O Nebuchadnezzar, we are under no necessity in this regard to say back a word to you.
{17}If it is to be, our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand, O king, he will rescue [us].
{18}But if not, let it become known to you, O king, that your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.”
|
{19}Then it was that Nebuchadnezzar himself got filled with fury, and the very expression of his face was changed toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. He was answering and saying to heat up the furnace seven times more than it was customary to heat it up.
{20}And to certain able-bodied men of vital energy who were in his military force he said to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, in order to throw [them] into the burning fiery furnace.
|
{21}Then it was that these able-bodied men were bound in their mantles, their garments and their caps and their other clothing and were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
{22}Just because the king’s word was harsh and the furnace was heated to excess, these able-bodied men that took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were the ones that the fiery flame killed.
{23}But these [other] able-bodied men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down bound in the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
|
{24}At that time Nebuchadnezzar the king himself became frightened and he rose up in a hurry. He was answering and saying to his high royal officials: “Was it not three able-bodied men that we threw bound into the midst of the fire?” They were answering and saying to the king: “Yes, O king.”
{25}He was answering and saying: “Look! I am beholding four able-bodied men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt to them, and the appearance of the fourth one is resembling a son of the gods.”
|
{26}Then it was that Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace. He was answering and saying: “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, YOU servants of the Most High God, step out and come here!” At that time Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were stepping out from the midst of the fire.
{27}And the satraps, the prefects and the governors and the high officials of the king that were assembled were beholding these able-bodied men, that the fire had had no power over their bodies, and not a hair of their head had been singed, and even their mantles had not been changed and the smell of fire itself had not come onto them.
|
{28}Nebuchadnezzar was answering and saying: “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants that trusted in him and that changed the very word of the king and gave over their bodies, because they would not serve and would not worship any god at all except their own God.
{29}And from me an order is being put through, that any people, national group or language that says anything wrong against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego should be dismembered, and its house should be turned into a public privy; forasmuch as there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.”
|
{30}At that time the king himself caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to prosper in the jurisdictional district of Babylon.
|
{1}“Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, national groups and languages that are dwelling in all the earth: May YOUR peace grow great.
{2}The signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed with me, it has seemed good to me to declare.
{3}How grand his signs are, and how mighty his wonders are! His kingdom is a kingdom to time indefinite, and his rulership is for generation after generation.
|
{4}“I, Nebuchadnezzar, happened to be at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
{5}There was a dream that I beheld, and it began to make me afraid. And there were mental images upon my bed and visions of my head that began to frighten me.
{6}And from me an order was being put through to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the very interpretation of the dream.
|
{7}“At that time the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the astrologers were entering; and I was saying before them what the dream was, but its interpretation they were not making known to me.
{8}And at last there came in before me Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom there is the spirit of the holy gods; and before him I said what the dream was:
|
{9}“‘O Belteshazzar the chief of the magic-practicing priests, because I myself well know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that there is no secret at all that is troubling you, tell [me] the visions of my dream that I have beheld and its interpretation.
|
{10}“‘Now the visions of my head upon my bed I happened to be beholding, and, look! a tree in the midst of the earth, the height of which was immense.
{11}The tree grew up and became strong, and its very height finally reached the heavens, and it was visible to the extremity of the whole earth.
{12}Its foliage was fair, and its fruit was abundant, and there was food for all on it. Under it the beast of the field would seek shade, and on its boughs the birds of the heavens would dwell, and from it all flesh would feed itself.
|
{13}“‘I continued beholding in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, look! a watcher, even a holy one, coming down from the heavens themselves.
{14}He was calling out loudly, and this is what he was saying: “CHOP the tree down, and cut off its boughs. SHAKE off its foliage, and scatter its fruitage. Let the beast flee from under it, and the birds from its boughs.
{15}However, LEAVE its rootstock itself in the earth, even with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field; and with the dew of the heavens let it be wet, and with the beast let its portion be among the vegetation of the earth.
{16}Let its heart be changed from that of mankind, and let the heart of a beast be given to it, and let seven times pass over it.
{17}By the decree of watchers the thing is, and [by] the saying of holy ones the request is, to the intent that people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that to the one whom he wants to, he gives it and he sets up over it even the lowliest one of mankind.”
|
{18}“‘This was the dream that I myself, King Nebuchadnezzar, beheld; and you yourself, O Belteshazzar, say what the interpretation is, forasmuch as all the [other] wise men of my kingdom are unable to make known to me the interpretation itself. But you are competent, because the spirit of holy gods is in you.’
|
{19}“At that time Daniel himself, whose name is Belteshazzar, was astonished for a moment, and his very thoughts began to frighten him.
|
{20}“‘The tree that you beheld, that grew great and became strong and the height of which finally reached the heavens and which was visible to all the earth,
{21}and the foliage of which was fair, and the fruit of which was abundant, and on which there was food for all; under which the beasts of the field would dwell, and on the boughs of which the birds of the heavens would reside,
{22}it is you, O king, because you have grown great and become strong, and your grandeur has grown great and reached to the heavens, and your rulership to the extremity of the earth.
|
{23}“‘And because the king beheld a watcher, even a holy one, coming down from the heavens, who was also saying: “CHOP the tree down, and RUIN it. However, LEAVE its rootstock itself in the earth, but with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field, and with the dew of the heavens let it become wet, and with the beasts of the field let its portion be until seven times themselves pass over it,”
{24}this is the interpretation, O king, and the decree of the Most High is that which must befall my lord the king.
{25}And you they will be driving away from men, and with the beasts of the field your dwelling will come to be, and the vegetation is what they will give even to you to eat just like bulls; and with the dew of the heavens you yourself will be getting wet, and seven times themselves will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that to the one whom he wants to he gives it.
|
{26}“‘And because they said to leave the rootstock of the tree, your kingdom will be sure to you after you know that the heavens are ruling.
{27}Therefore, O king, may my counsel seem good to you, and remove your own sins by righteousness, and your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor ones. Maybe there will occur a lengthening of your prosperity.’”
|
{28}All this befell Nebuchadnezzar the king.
|
{29}At the end of twelve lunar months he happened to be walking upon the royal palace of Babylon.
{30}The king was answering and saying: “Is not this Babylon the Great, that I myself have built for the royal house with the strength of my might and for the dignity of my majesty?”
|
{31}While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, there was a voice that fell from the heavens: “To you it is being said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, ‘The kingdom itself has gone away from you,
{32}and from mankind they are driving even you away, and with the beasts of the field your dwelling will be. Vegetation they will give even to you to eat just like bulls, and seven times themselves will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that to the one whom he wants to he gives it.’”
|
{33}At that moment the word itself was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and from mankind he was being driven away, and vegetation he began to eat just like bulls, and with the dew of the heavens his own body got to be wet, until his very hair grew long just like eagles’ [feathers] and his nails like birds’ [claws].
|
{34}“And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up to the heavens my eyes, and my own understanding began to return to me; and I blessed the Most High himself, and the One living to time indefinite I praised and glorified, because his rulership is a rulership to time indefinite and his kingdom is for generation after generation.
{35}And all the inhabitants of the earth are being considered as merely nothing, and he is doing according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth. And there exists no one that can check his hand or that can say to him, ‘What have you been doing?’
|
{36}“At the same time my understanding itself began to return to me, and for the dignity of my kingdom my majesty and my brightness themselves began to return to me; and for me even my high royal officers and my grandees began eagerly searching, and I was reestablished upon my own kingdom, and greatness extraordinary was added to me.
|
{37}“Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, am praising and exalting and glorifying the King of the heavens, because all his works are truth and his ways are justice, and because those who are walking in pride he is able to humiliate.”
|
{1}As regards Belshazzar the king, he made a big feast for a thousand of his grandees, and in front of the thousand he was drinking wine.
{2}Belshazzar, under the influence of the wine, said to bring in the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken away from the temple that was in Jerusalem, that from them the king and his grandees, his concubines and his secondary wives might drink.
{3}At that time they brought in the vessels of gold that they had taken away from the temple of the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and from them the king and his grandees, his concubines and his secondary wives drank.
{4}They drank wine, and they praised the gods of gold and of silver, copper, iron, wood and stone.
|
{5}At that moment the fingers of a man’s hand came forth and were writing in front of the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was beholding the back of the hand that was writing.
{6}At that time, as regards the king, his very complexion was changed in him, and his own thoughts began to frighten him, and his hip joints were loosening and his very knees were knocking each other.
|
{7}The king was calling out loudly to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the astrologers. The king was answering and saying to the wise men of Babylon: “Any man that will read this writing and show me its very interpretation, with purple he will be clothed, with a necklace of gold about his neck, and as the third one in the kingdom he will rule.”
|
{8}At that time all the wise men of the king were coming in, but they were not competent enough to read the writing itself or to make known to the king the interpretation.
{9}Consequently King Belshazzar was very much frightened and his complexion was changing within him; and his grandees were perplexed.
|
{10}As regards the queen, because of the words of the king and his grandees she entered right into the banqueting hall. The queen answered and said: “O king, keep living even to times indefinite. Do not let your thoughts frighten you, nor let your complexion be changed.
{11}There exists a capable man in your kingdom in whom there is the spirit of holy gods; and in the days of your father illumination and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar your father himself set him up as chief of the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the Chaldeans [and] the astrologers, [even] your father, O king;
{12}forasmuch as an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams and the explanation of riddles and the untying of knots had been found in him, in Daniel, whom the king himself named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel himself be called, that he may show the very interpretation.”
|
{13}Accordingly Daniel himself was brought in before the king. The king was speaking up and saying to Daniel: “Are you the Daniel that is of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
{14}I have also heard concerning you that the spirit of gods is in you, and illumination and insight and wisdom extraordinary have been found in you.
{15}And now there have been brought in before me the wise men [and] the conjurers, that they may read this very writing, even to make known to me its interpretation; but they are not competent enough to show the very interpretation of the word.
{16}And I myself have heard concerning you, that you are able to furnish interpretations and to untie knots themselves. Now, if you are able to read the writing and to make known to me its very interpretation, with purple you will be clothed, with a necklace of gold around your neck, and as the third one in the kingdom you will rule.”
|
{17}At that time Daniel was answering and saying before the king: “Let your gifts prove to be to you yourself, and your presents do you give to others. However, I shall read the writing itself to the king, and the interpretation I shall make known to him.
{18}As for you, O king, the Most High God himself gave to Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and the greatness and the dignity and the majesty.
{19}And because of the greatness that He gave him, all peoples, national groups and languages proved to be quaking and showing fear before him. Whom he happened to want to, he was killing; and whom he happened to want to, he was striking; and whom he happened to want to, he was exalting; and whom he happened to want to, he was humiliating.
{20}But when his heart became haughty and his own spirit became hard, so as to act presumptuously, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and his own dignity was taken away from him.
{21}And from the sons of mankind he was driven away, and his very heart was made like that of a beast, and with the wild asses his dwelling was. Vegetation they would give him to eat just like bulls, and with the dew of the heavens his own body got to be wet, until he knew that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that the one whom he wants to, he sets up over it.

{22}“And as for you, his son Belshazzar, you have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this.
{23}But against the Lord of the heavens you exalted yourself, and they brought before you even the vessels of his house; and you yourself and your grandees, your concubines and your secondary wives have been drinking wine from them, and you have praised mere gods of silver and of gold, copper, iron, wood and stone, that are beholding nothing or hearing nothing or knowing nothing; but the God in whose hand your breath is and to whom all your ways belong you have not glorified.
{24}Consequently from before him there was being sent the back of a hand, and this very writing was inscribed.
{25}And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN.
|
{26}“This is the interpretation of the word: MENE, God has numbered [the days of] your kingdom and has finished it.
|
{27}“TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and have been found deficient.
|
{28}“PERES, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.”
|
{29}At that time Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, with a necklace of gold about his neck; and they heralded concerning him that he was to become the third ruler in the kingdom.
|
{30}In that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed
{31}and Darius the Mede himself received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
